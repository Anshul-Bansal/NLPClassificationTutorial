## Padding of text input

<p>Padding is required to make all the input of same length. Same length input are necessary for many nn models. Following are some question that we need to explore?</p>

1. The padding should be pre or post? 
2. How padding and truncating affects accuracy of the model?
3. How padding affect the speed of the algorithm?
4. Truncating should be pre or post?


## batch size
1. How bacth size affects the accuracy and time in model training and inference?
